# NPV-Analysis---Project-Greenspace

During a weekly project meeting, one of your team members presents an exciting new project, Project Greenspace. After she presents, you have a chance to review the documents with the team and discuss some possible scenarios to help the team make a recommendation about whether the company should pursue the project.

I decide to perform a Net Present Value (NPV) analysis to determine the profitability of Project Greenspace. The Net Present Value determines the present value of the future cash inflows and outflows over the life the project.
