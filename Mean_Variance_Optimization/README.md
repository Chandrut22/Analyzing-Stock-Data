# Mean-Variance-Optimization

Youâ€™re an investment analyst at a large fund. You specialize in calculating efficient frontiers and selecting assets for portfolios.

This project is split into three tasks, each with its own Python file:

    1.Follow the steps to calculate the efficient frontier of a portfolio with five assets (script1.py)
    2.See how two additional assets affect the efficient frontier from part one (script2.py)
    3.Use the covariance matrix and expected returns from ten assets to select the five assets that produce the best efficient frontier (script3.py)

You can select the tabs at the top of the screen to switch between files.
